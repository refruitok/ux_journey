# User Journey Generator

An AI-driven system for early assumption testing, rapid synthesis, and controlled exploration of alternative user journeys.

## Overview

The **User Journey Generator** is a decision-support environment for UX, product, and service teams to model, branch, and evaluate multiple plausible user journeys under uncertainty—before commitment, build, or rollout.

Rather than producing a single "happy path," the system enables teams to generate, compare, and stress-test alternative journeys, making trade-offs, risks, and missed opportunities visible early.

## Core Purpose

- **Faster Synthesis:** Quickly combine research signals, hypotheses, and design intent.
- **Systematic Option Exploration:** Prevent premature convergence by exploring the full option space.
- **Early Exposure of Assumptions:** Surface hidden assumptions before they solidify into costly decisions.

## Frameworks & Methodology

The generator integrates industry-standard frameworks to provide deep insights:

*   **Google Micro-Moments:** Models intent-driven decision thresholds (Know, Go, Do, Buy) as branching points.
*   **Jobs To Be Done (JTBD):** Grounds each step in functional, emotional, and situational jobs.
*   **Sludge & Friction Audit:** Detects hesitation, cognitive load, ambiguity, and trust gaps.

## Key Features

- **Journey Mapping:** Visualized steps with integrated Micro-Moments and JTBD data.
- **Branching Scenarios:** Explore alternative paths and "What If" disruptions.
- **AI Visuals:** Photorealistic scene generation powered by Imagen 3.0.
- **Quantitative Scoring:** CX quality and time/effort cost analysis.
- **Intervention Opportunities:** Identified per step and per path.
